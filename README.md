# [Awesome Leetcode](https://github.com/Wolf-Alexander/awesome-leetcode) 

Starting with Leetcode is pretty difficult, cause you don't know where to start. And even if you have an exact topic you wanna practice you'll probably have problems to find a good leetcode question to start

So that's why I will give you a thorough introduction to Leetcode and all the different topics where you could start and how to advance

### Step 1: Where to start

Leetcode has at the time this tutorial is being made **3642 questions**. Then where should you start? Many people would start with the first question hoping that leetcode would order the questions by difficulty, but unfortunately it isn't that easy to find your way at the beginning 

Still I would recommend you to start with **1. Two Sum**. This is the first question and a great introduction into what you're getting into

### Step 2: How to solve a Leetcode question

For this example we'll use **1. Two Sum** as an introduction

After reading this instruction the first thing you should be aware are the given examples

In many cases, those examples can really help you understand the question. If this also doesn't help, you can find comments below this question. If you're struggling with understanding the question, then maybe someone else also has a problem with it

After trying to solve this question, you can run it and try it with the given test cases that are shown in the examples. If every one of these test cases is correct, you can submit your code and it will be tested for every test case made for this question

If you're out of ideas, there are hints below, and if you want a better understanding of how this question can be solved, Leetcode offers you an **Editorial** which explains some approaches to this question, but I would recommend you go to **Solutions** and you can find other people explaining how to solve those questions in such a good quality that you would think they studied this question for years
